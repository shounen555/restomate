- US002: View all workers  
- US003: Edit worker details
- US004: Delete workers
- US005: Assign roles

**Deliverables**:

## Database Design Strategy
- Start with simple tables for Sprint 1
- Add relationships and complexity in later sprints
- Use proper foreign keys and constraints
- Plan for ingredient transformation system

## Git Workflow
- **Main branch**: Production-ready code
- **Feature branches**: One per sprint (e.g., `RestoMate-1`)
- **Commit regularly**: Small, meaningful commits
- **Merge strategy**: Feature branch â†’ Main after sprint completion

## Development Approach
- **Agile**: 2-3 week sprints with working deliverables
- **Database First**: Design tables before coding
- **API First**: Build Laravel backend, then React frontend
- **Simple UI**: Start with basic Tailwind components, enhance later

## Next Steps for Sprint 1
1. âœ… Create project plan (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Design Worker UML diagram in StarUML
3. ðŸ”„ Create database migrations
4. ðŸ”„ Build Laravel models and API
5. ðŸ”„ Create React components
6. ðŸ”„ Connect frontend and backend
7. ðŸ”„ Test and deploy Sprint 1

## Notes
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Focus on working features over perfect design
- Use Japanese restaurant terminology where appropriate
- Keep UI clean and professional
